# Audio Quantization
Welcome to the Audio Quantization repository! This project contains a series of experiments related to the Encodec model, exploring various configurations of loss functions and quantizations. All experiments are documented in Jupyter notebooks for easy replication and analysis.

## Data
The 24khz audio datasets used in these experiments are available for download from Google Drive. Please download the data from this link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wa1rZh_gqCkVtnbwEThCONRCeA0I_9Iu?usp=sharing and after extrating the data, place the extracted directories in the data directory within the repository. This ensures that all notebooks can access the required data seamlessly. train24khz, val24khz and test24khz contain the 1 second files used for training the networks. orig_train24khz, orig_val24khz and orig_test24khz contain the full utterances.
